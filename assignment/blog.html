    <h1>Municipal solid waste dumping</h1>

      In this study, the surface soil samples (n=12) were randomly collected
      from both the waste dump and the non dumpsites (control). The
      characterization of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) at dumpsites indicated a
      significant higher proportion of biodegradable waste (71%). Hence, the
      analysis of soil samples showed a high pH, TDS, EC, volatile solids and
      organic carbon in comparison to control sites. Similarly, the increased
      con-centration of heavy metals was observed. Overall, the mean metal
      concentrations at dumpsites soil were in the following descending order:
      Zn>Cr>Pb>Cu>Ni>Cd. Ex-cept for lead, the analyzed metals concentration was
      found below the permissible lim-its. However, on comparison with control
      sites, the trend indicated the likely increase in pollutant concentration.
      The study therefore concluded that MSW dumping has not only altered the
      soil color and texture, but also has changed the physico-chemical
      constituents. These findings might help in proper management of municipal
      solid waste in Karachi
